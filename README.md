$\textbf{Finding eclipse}$

Our problem is to expect solar and lunar eclipses that will occur in the next 1 year. We consider this problem as an initial value problem. The initial value is the given position and velocity data of planets. We use $\beta$-method to solve it and implement newton's method for implicit $'\beta'$-method.
