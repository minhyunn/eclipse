#Predict eclipse

Our problem is to predict solar and lunar eclipses that will occur in the next 1 year. We consider this problem as an initial value problem. The initial value, the positions and velocities of planets are given. We use beta-method to solve this problem and for implicit beta-method, we implement newton's method.

#Predict house price

The data set given contains information that people consider when they buy a house, such as the year built, number of bedrooms, and quality of a house. The target variable, the sale price of a house is given in the training set and not in the test set. We wish to predict the sales price for each house in the test set. We use a linear regression model for it and evaluate the model with Root Mean Squared Error.
